## About The Project




This project's purpose was to apply the learning of API expose to data that was formated through a serializer. Principles and structure of RESTful routes and MVC were followed. A total of 11 different end point were exposed and included search funtions for both a merchant and a list of items based on a search query. Testing was performed via Rspec and used Factory Bot in conjunction with Faker to produce test data.
